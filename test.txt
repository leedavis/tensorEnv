Yes Joaquin's performance is good and the cinematography is pretty but otherwise I do not get all the hype about this movie. Not for a long time have I felt like I would be better off leaving the cinema than staying and getting my money's worth. For something that was supposed to be gritty and real it had a lot of convenient scenes to help push the plot along. Very disappointed.
